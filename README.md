# 🙂 Hi, I’m @Raspberry693
- 🐍 I’m always interested to learn about Python, and Front-End Web Development.
- 🏫 Currently I'm into Front-End Web and Python.
- 😛 I don't know a whole lot yet, but I'm getting there!

## Current Projects
Recently I've been working a LOT on my Make-Bank-Game repo.
I've had several ideas for browser based games, but I can't decide on what to do.
