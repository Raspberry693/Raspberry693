# Raspberry693
- ⁉ Always intrigued by Python, frustrated by APIs, love/hate relationship with HTML DOM, and can't do it with the backend.
- 🏫 Currently I'm into Chrome Extensions Development, Front-End Web Design, and everything Python.
- 😛 Learning how to work on a dev team!

## Current Projects
I've been recently developing addons for the open source project ScratchAddons. I've been dabbling a lot with Chrome extensions and the web store. Along with toying with APIs, I like to "Scratch" at https://scratch.mit.edu.

## Away From the Screen
I enjoy working on school math problems (and confusing my classmates). Playing ping pong has been a large part of my free time. Figuring out a college plan and where to go after that. Puzzle solving always keeps my mind busy, as well as playing board games. (Ever heard of Exploding Kittens?)
