# 🙂 Hi, I’m @Raspberry693
- 🐍 I’m always interested to learn about Python, and Front-End Web Development.
- 🏫 Currently I'm into Front-End Web and Python.
- 😛 I don't know a whole lot yet, but I'm getting there!

## Current Projects
Currently working on a Gmail API chrome extension. It simply adds a little button to every page in your browser, and when you click it it composes a new email!
